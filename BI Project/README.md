**Here, I will give a quick and brief demonstration what I did in BI Project:**
1. [Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11P9LU8-f--7PkJYkhp6_eTLnnDRGgTNI/view?usp=drive_link) to quick preview to Dashboards in PDF format.
2. **Highlights** in the article:
- $\color{green}{\textsf{Product}}$ : ***The Bikes*** product group brings the <ins>**highest profits**</ins> to the business (<ins>**5 times**</ins> more than other product groups), however the <ins>**Brand Regconigtion**</ins> of this product line is being affected by product diversification. Businesses need to have a strategy to regain brand recognition for Bikes, and remove unpopular products: some products such as ***silver/black/gray accessories*** and ***XL size*** shorts are not popular with customers. Businesses need to find out the reasons and consider $\color{red}{\textsf{eliminating}}$ these products.
- $\color{green}{\textsf{Geography}}$ : needs to focus on maintaining and expanding the market in the United States and Australia, while developing other markets with the right strategy. It is necessary to <ins>**deploy bicycle maintenance services**</ins> and carry out effective marketing activities to increase revenue and profits. After-sales customer care is also an important factor to retain customers and build brand reputation.
- $\color{green}{\textsf{Customers}}$ : Customer segmentation brings many benefits to businesses. Adventure Works needs to analyze the market and customer behavior to come up with appropriate strategies for each segment. Businesses also need to pay attention to <ins>**the rate of returning customers**</ins> and <ins>**the growth in the number of customers**</ins> to ensure sustainable development.
